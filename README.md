## Settings

### Custom command

You might want to prefix the rspec command with something like docker or foreman.

With this configuration you can customize your rspec command as you please. Example when using foreman:

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.custom-command": "foreman run bundle exec rspec --color"
}
```

### Custom folder

You want to work in other folder. With this configuration you can customize rspec command to run a custom folder.

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.folder": "test"
}
```

### Custom Suffix File

You want to work with other suffix file, for exemplo, if you use Minitest, you set `_test.rb` suffix. So, with this configuration you might customize suffix file. 

```json
{
    "vscode-run-rspec-file.suffix": "test"
}
```

The default is `bundle exec rspec --color`.

You can also customize it per project by adding the same configuration to your project's `.vscode/settings.json`.

### Custom folder for controller specs

You should now write specs for your controllers as request specs ([source](http://rspec.info/blog/2016/07/rspec-3-5-has-been-released/)). The default thus is to create controller specs at `spec/requests`, but this can be changed via:

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.controller-spec-directory": "requests"
}
```

### Custom integration type

You can configure kind of integration would you use. Like `rails` or `lib` `others`. When `rails` is activated, we go mount workspace folder based in your structure for folders. For example:

Rails usually use `app`, `lib`, `spec` or `test` folders, so, in your workspace must be first part before this folders. This add suport to use in multi-root/folders projects.

```json
{ "vscode-run-rspec-file.integration": "rails" }
```

### Use cases

Project use another format to tests, like as:

```
| MundiAPI-RUBY
  |- lib
  |- test
    |- test_charges_controller.rb
```

So you can configure like this.

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.custom-command": "bundle exec rake test",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.folder": "test",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.suffix": "",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.integration": "other"
}
```

Another example, when use minitest instead of rspec

```
| packwerk
  |- lib
  |- test
    |- integration
      |- packwerk
        |- custom_executable_integration_test.rb
```

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.custom-command": "bundle exec rake test",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.folder": "test",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.suffix": "test",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.integration": "minitest"
}
```

As result `bundle exec rake test test/integration/packwerk/custom_executable_integration_test.rb`

And using Rails like Application and RSpec.

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.custom-command": "bundle exec rspec",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.folder": "spec",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.suffix": "spec",
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.integration": "rails"
}
```
